[Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/) can run in [agent mode](https://dozzle.dev/guide/agent) which can expose Docker hosts to other Dozzle instances. All communication is done over a secured connection using TLS. This means that you can deploy Dozzle on a remote host and connect to it from your local machine.
